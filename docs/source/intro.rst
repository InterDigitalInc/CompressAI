Introduction
============

Concept
~~~~~~~

CompressAI is built on top of PyTorch and provides:

* custom operations, layers and models for deep learning based data compression

* a partial port of the official `TensorFlow compression
  <https://github.com/tensorflow/compression>`_ library

* pre-trained end-to-end compression models for learned image compression

* evaluation scripts to compare learned models against classical image/video
  compression codecs


CompressAI aims to allow more researchers to contribute to the learned 
image and video compression domain, by providing resources to research, 
implement and evaluate machine learning based compression codecs.


Model Zoo
~~~~~~~~~

CompressAI includes some pre-trained models for compression tasks. See the Model 
Zoo section for more documentation.

The list of available models, trained at different bit-rate distortion points
and with different metrics, is expected to grow in the future.
