    """Gaussian conditional for compressing latent ``y`` using ``ctx_params``.

    Probability model for Gaussian of ``(scales, means)``.

    Gaussian conditonal entropy model introduced in
    `"Variational Image Compression with a Scale Hyperprior"
    <https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01436>`_,
    by J. Balle, D. Minnen, S. Singh, S.J. Hwang, and N. Johnston,
    International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2018.

    .. note:: Unlike the original paper, which models only the scale
       (i.e. "width") of the Gaussian, this implementation models both
       the scale and the mean (i.e. "center") of the Gaussian.
