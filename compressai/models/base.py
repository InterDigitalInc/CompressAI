        In contrast to the primary "net" loss used by the "net"
        optimizer, the "aux" loss is only used by the "aux" optimizer to
        update *only* the ``EntropyBottleneck.quantiles`` parameters. In
        fact, the "aux" loss does not depend on image data at all.

        The purpose of the "aux" loss is to determine the range within
        which most of the mass of a given distribution is contained, as
        well as its median (i.e. 50% probability). That is, for a given
        distribution, the "aux" loss converges towards satisfying the
        following conditions for some chosen ``tail_mass`` probability:

        * ``cdf(quantiles[0]) = tail_mass / 2``
        * ``cdf(quantiles[1]) = 0.5``
        * ``cdf(quantiles[2]) = 1 - tail_mass / 2``

        This ensures that the concrete ``_quantized_cdf``\s operate
        primarily within a finitely supported region. Any symbols
        outside this range must be coded using some alternative method
        that does *not* involve the ``_quantized_cdf``\s. Luckily, one
        may choose a ``tail_mass`` probability that is sufficiently
        small so that this rarely occurs. It is important that we work
        with ``_quantized_cdf``\s that have a small finite support;
        otherwise, entropy coding runtime performance would suffer.
        Thus, ``tail_mass`` should not be too small, either!
