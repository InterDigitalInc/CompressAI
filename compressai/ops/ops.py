    Rounding with non-zero gradients. Gradients are approximated by replacing
    the derivative by the identity function.

    Used in `"Lossy Image Compression with Compressive Autoencoders" <https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00395>`_

    .. note::

        Implemented with the pytorch `detach()` reparametrization trick:

        `x_round = x_round - x.detach() + x`
    """
    return torch.round(x) - x.detach() + x
