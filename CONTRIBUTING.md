## Coding style

We try to follow PEP 8 recommendations. Automatic formatting is performed via
[ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/).

## Testing

We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/5.4.3/getting-started.html). To run
all the tests:

* `pip install pytest pytest-cov coverage`
* `python -m pytest --cov=compressai -s`
* You can run `coverage report` or `coverage html` to visualize the tests
  coverage analysis
